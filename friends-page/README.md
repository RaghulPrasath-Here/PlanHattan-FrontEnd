## Comments for my code

- useStates = manages form inputs, friends list, editing sate, reminder flags
- map() and setState or immutability, editing and sharing plans
- handleAddFriend/Invite/Remind = control user interaction
- Aria = for accessibility
- setTimeout = for temporary UI feedback - disappears after 2 seconds
- editing Plan matches friendId and index to help between edit and view mode
- each list item is keyed by index
- there are classes based on the plans status - accepted or pending 
- onShare and setNewPlan = to update shared state in the parent components
